## Twide and Twejudice (2014)

Pride and Prejudice with (almost) each word of the dialogue replaced
with another word in the same
[hierarchical Twitter cluster](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/cluster_viewer.html),
that is, with another word that is used in a similar context on Twitter
as computed by the CMU TweetNLP project.

In the second link, both dialogue and prose are subject to the same treatment.
